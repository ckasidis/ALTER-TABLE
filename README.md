Our team has developed a new **personalised dashboard for consignees (MyNinja)** that provides a wide range of options and user-friendly interface for managing their orders.

## Features

* User Credential: Login to the dashboard using their phone number that associates with orders.
* Orders Overview: View status of current orders, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and order history.
* Order Management: Change address, choose order aggregation option, or select delivery window service.
* Profile Management: Store and update their addresses, and also indicate address preference by days in the week.

## How to use the dashboard

1. Login to the dashboard using your phone number, verify reCAPTCHA, and enter OTP sent to your number.<br/><br/>
2. On the Preferences site, you can see saved addresses, which you can always add a new one. In here, you can also manage notifications before delivery. <br/><br/>
3. Using navigation bar, you can move to Orders Page. Here, you will see all orders including current and completed orders. For current orders, you can see essential information such as address, contact info, delivery instruction, and option for leaving parcel, and ETA for On The Way orders. <br/><br/>
In managing orders, you have options to: <br/>
    - Edit Information on orders before it leaves sorting hub
    - Request new delivery window based on your availability with alteration fees (if not available at the ETA)
    - Check driver's approval on the requests
